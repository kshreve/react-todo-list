2. Users should be able to edit (i.e. change the text of) existing todos.  
3. Users should be able to delete existing todos.
4. Users should be able to reorder the list of existing todos.
5. In the bottom half of the page, all of the existing inputs and their contents should be live updated in real-time (as the user is typing) in plain text
